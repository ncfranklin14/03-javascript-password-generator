# 03-javascript-password-generator
homework 3 

## Description

* For this homework I used Javascript and HTML to create a password gnerator. By doing this project I was able to practice using a whole variety of "tools in my toolbox" including: Variables, Arrays, Array Methods, functions, and pop-up boxes. I learned how to merge arrays and pull them into a function. It was a good project to pull all my skills together and build something I could actually use! 

## Usage

Click the "generate password" button and you will be prompted to answer what criteria you want in your password. Once you answer all the prompts, a randomly and secure password will be generated and be displayed in the text box.
